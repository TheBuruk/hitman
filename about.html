<h1>Hitman: Contracts Routlette</h1>
This is a simple variation of Hitman: Blood Money roulette.

<h2>Metrics</h2>
<li>Silent Assassin rating, Proffessional difficulty
<li>Close Combat kills (Fiber Wire and melee can be distinguished by the given items in the level if asked.)
<li>If the game asks you just for a CC kill then any CC kill is allowed. If it's specified, then the player has to obtain that item from the level.
<li>Loud and silenced weaponries may be included.
<li>If a specific waepon that do not exist in the level is asked, then the player can bring it through NG+ (NG+=completion after a new game.)
<li>If no knock outs is asked then the player shouldn't try other means of KO'ing NPCs.
<li>Heading start points may not vary too much, but every level has some kind of different way of routing (e.g. suit only or main enterances.)
<li>If the player is asked to obtain an item, then that can be obtained until the end of the run.
<li>Specific disguises for kills can be changed before and after objective completion.
